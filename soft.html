        <h4>Training and Internship -- 2 months Of Training with 1 month of Internship With MICROSOFT-Langify</h4>
        <h4> COINCENT TRAINING </h4>
        <p>This the training and Internship Program offered by Coincent , I utilize this opurtunities and I have Enrolled Into The Training
            The training is for 2 months , after the training They have kept The Azure Fundamentals Microsoft Examination,I have cleared The Examination with The Score of 700/1000
           From this result i got a opputunity to get a Internship with Microsoft - Langify , During The Internship They give a brief tutorial of Azure and they Trained The Deep Learning PROJECT
           which it focus on training the Model {Deep Learning Project -- Fashion Minist Data Classifier. }</p>

        <p style="background-color: rgb(242, 7, 7); font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">In this project, I have built a fashion apparel recognition using the
          Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. To train the CNN model,
          I have used the Fashion MNIST dataset. After successful training,
          the CNN model can predict the name of the class given apparel item
          belongs to. This is a multiclass classification problem in which there
          are 10 apparel classes the items will be classified.
          The fashion training set consists of 70,000 images divided into 60,000
          training and 10,000 testing samples. Dataset sample consists of 28x28
          grayscale images, associated with a label from 10 classes.
          So the end goal is to train and test the model using Convolution Neural network.</p>

          <h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW:</h3>
          <p>My Project Mainly Aims on determining a naming taxonomy to categorize 
            and Analise the data and ways to improve it. Fashion MNIST DATA 
            CLASSIFIER mainly focus on Training a Model to compare the significant 
            features of the data .
           </p>
           <li>  To condense the mass of data in such a manner that similarities and 
            dissimilarities can be readily apprehended. 
            </li>
            <li> To facilitate comparison.
              </li>
              <li>
                 To point out the most significant features of the data at a glance.
             
              </li>
              <li>  To focus the important information collected</li>
